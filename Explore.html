     <h3>Response 2A</h3>
     The computing innovation I chose is 3D Printers.The purpose
    of a 3D printer is to create multiple items with different 
    materials on one machine. A 3D printer works by designing a
    blueprint in a computer. When the blueprint is done it is 
    used to tell the 3D printer were to lay down materials that
    would create the 3D model. Successful layers are placed 
    horizontally across-section near the previous solid 3D 
    printer model.This artifact shows, how an object is created 
    with a 3D printer and the processes it takes to make it.

 I created this artifact by using GIMP image editor.The program 
 I used to create this artifact is GIMP Image Editor. First, I 
 did was search some images about 3D printers. I looked through 
 the images that proved how a 3D printer process the slices of 
 layer materials in making a solid 3D model. After I had the
 pictures that I needed from my artifact, I when to GIMP Image 
 Editor. Then I started to create the artifact by placing the
 images together that I had chosen on the GIMP page to edit.
 My final processes were making the images stand out proving 
 the main idea of a 3D printer.

 <h3>Response 2C</h3>
 One effect of a 3D printers is that it will increase jobs for
 engineers and  fabricators to design products and produce 
 printers. This innovation is beneficial because the technology
 of a 3D printer creates multiple objects in less time and with
 the highest quality in graphics(1). For example, like companies 
 that produce many objects, the 3D printer would be very 
 beneficial for that, because when using a 3D printer, the 
 objects can be manufactured in less time and faster will be on 
 sale in the market. A 3D printer is not only beneficial for 
 companies that consume 3D objects. It can be beneficial for 
 anyone.The impact of this innovation on economy is that many 
 companies are using 3D printers to manufacture objects in less 
 time and selling them at a high price (2). With 3D printers, 
 companies will make a lot of money. On the other hand, this 
 innovation is harmful due to the fumes 3D printers release. 
 People who produce a large number of 3D models have a higher
 chance of getting carcinogen (cancer). Levels much higher than 
 recommended by California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard
 Assessment (3). Due to the smoke consumed by a 3D printer and by
 different materials like liquids and plastics that are used in a
 3D printer.

 <h3>Response 2D</h3>
 The data that my innovation uses is a 3D model of an object that 
 tells the 3D printer what to build (4). My innovation processes 
 data by reading computer-aided design (CAD) files. These designs
 tell the 3D printer how to place successive layers, plastics, 
 polymers, and a metal material on the 3D printer to create the 
 3D model. A data storage concern is that if a consumer wanted to
 make a big 3D model the consumer would have to buy a big and 
 expensive computer to make the model because it would need a lot
 computer storage and memory.
