 <h3>2A)</h3>
My program is written in JavaScript with the use of the
p5.js library. The purpose of my program is to change the
emojis randomly. In this video clip you can see how the
different emojis change to another different emoji after
the button is clicked. And how different emoji reactions
change to random ones at a time. 

</p>

<p>
<h3>2B)</h3> 
My partner and I used iterative pair programming by first
writing the sentences for the array, then we made an array
in order for the programer to choose what word to replace
with the name, age and ice Cream.  After that we used the 
code to make the sentences pop up in the HTML. Finally we
used the code math.random to choose random words from the
string name, age and ice Cream when the button was clicked.
My partner and I wrote sentences together so when the
button was clicked it would changed the strings inside the
name, age and ice Cream array randomly. Independently I
created a program that changes the images when ever I 
press the button. The first developmental challenge I 
encountered was not knowing were I had an infinite loop 
that was running forever.  It was important to fix the
infinite loop running in my code because whenever I clicked
the button it would not change to a random images. I solved
this challenge by replacing the underscore with a star
because links can not have star in them. The second 
evelopmental challenge I encountered was another 
loop that was running forever that appeared in my 
code happer fixing the loop mentioned before. It was 
important to fix the loop that was running forever because 
it broke the code. I solved this challenge by changing the
letter in the code that was causing the code to brake.

The purpose of this algorithm is to change the strings to formatted
a message. When this function runs correctly, it takes the value
of the input from the string to replace emojis tokens with images.
The algorithm is able to achieve this result by looking for
tokens in the string that resembles the winky, happy and sad face.
When it finds a token it replaces the token with an image tag .
If this program did not include this algorithm, it would not
function as desired because it is essential to the program. This 
algorithm works with two other sub algorithms that are both 
mathematical and that are <pre><code>function
replace() and winky[Math.floor(Math.random()*4)] 
winky[Math.floor(Math.random()*4)]</code></pre> sub algorithm is mathematical 
and picks a random string from the array called <pre><code> let winky[];</code></pre> So
that each time the button is clicked it changes the winky face 
to another different winky face. The replace() function works by
calling before, after, and full.<pre><code> let before = str.slice(0, index);</code></pre>
works by holding the string chunk before the winky face.
<pre><code> let after = str.slice(index + 4); </code></pre>works by holds the string 
chunk  after the winky face. And <pre><code> 
let full = before + replacement + after; </code></pre>works by putting the 
string that was taken before and after the token winky face all together. 
</p>

<h3>2D)</h3>
<pre><code> function replace(str, replacement, index)
 {
 </code></pre>
  before holds the string chunk before the winky face 
<pre><code> let before = str.slice(0, index);
 console.log(before);
 </code></pre>
    after holds the string chunk after the winky face
 <pre><code>let after = str.slice(index + 4);
  console.log(after);
 </code></pre>
<pre><code> let full = before + replacement + after;
 return full;
 }
 </code></pre>
 
An example of an abstraction in my program is function replace(); 
This simplifies my program by replacing the token emojis. I 
created this function replace(); to avoid repeating the process 
of inputting random strings that the array has. If this abstraction
were not present, then the sentences would not select the token emojis 
and therefore it would not make a sentence with the emojis changing
randomly.
