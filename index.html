    <p>I'm in Computer science Pathway. I enjoy spending my time in
    sports. For example, soccer and valleyball. I live with both 
    of my parents and I have 3 brothers. My parents are my 
    inspiration because they believe in me and they work
    hard everyday to help me achieve
    the goals I have for myself.</p>
