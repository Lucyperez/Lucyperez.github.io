         <h3 id="Organizer">Organizer</h3>
    <p>I believe that organizer is being able to know the things
    you have plan for the week, months and years.
    Organizer is scheduling your world to make it better. I believe 
    that having a list of things in my life helps me have control
    over the time.Just having my life organize gives me a good 
    step ahead than everyone one else. I believe that organizing 
    little things brings me big joy, accomplisment and responsability 
    in life. </p>
    
    <p>Being organized is a big responsability in my life and 
    a daily thing I do every day. It doesn't only help me feel organized 
    but makes me feel more confident with myself. An example, is waking up in
    the morning, going to school, coming back home, doing homework,
    going to church etc.</p>
    
    <p>I see this theme in my life by
    always keeping all my work organized in school or out of school.</p>
    
    <hp>How it feels to use my strength.</p>
    
    <p>Being organized feels like you control what you do today or tomorrow.
    But at times it can be stressing due to all the homework I have to do
    and the hours I spend at school.</p>
    
    <p>When using my strength I feel great most of the time because 
    it helps me keep track of the things that suround me or it gives me a bigger
    picture of who I am.</p>
    
    <p>Organizer is being able to do things in a specific order.</P>

    <h3 id="Achieving">Achieving</h3>
    
    <p>Achieving is you having more energy and more goals than other people.
    You love a sense of accomplishment.You are in a hurry to get 
    started and make things happen because you almost always have
    a list in your mind of the things you want to get done. It is 
    fun to achieve small goals and even more exciting to achieve 
    big goals that challenge you.The more things you accomplish
    the better you feel about yourself. Achieving is wanting to 
    do more than enough. </p>
    
    <p>I see achievement in my life when I get good 
    grades, when I get things done on time. When people congradualte
    me from working hard.</p>
   
    <p> Being able to use this strength feels like wanting 
    to do more. Feels like you just want to keep going and 
    never stoping. Achieving things feels greate when things are 
    done to help others. For example, at Sant Elizabeth I'm an 
    altar server, when your infront of more than 400 people it 
    feels nurvous but exiting too. Once you finish serving 
    it's like a deep breath you take to relax yourself. 
    Being an altar server is just not about helping out
    but being infront of lots of people. Accomplishing a
    goal is like you wanting to cry for succeeding even 
    if it's not winning.  </p>
    
    <p>How do I use this strength in my Life:</p>

             <li>Exams</li>

    <h3 id="Caring">Caring</h3>
    
    <p>I believe that helping others is very important. 
    Caring about their needs is like caring about you.
     Caring is like want to make the world better by helping 
     people in small ways or big ways. When someone feels 
     left out, I help him or her be part of my group.
     I encourage people, to share with others, and help
     them learn what they miss. I like helping others even 
     if they don't want my help.  </p>
    
    <p>Caring comes up a lot with my little brother because
    he doesn have a lot of pacients and. I care a lot about him 
    because he's the youngest and how he doesn know a lot of things.
    I take care of him everyday even if it≈õ annoying. Caring is not 
    only caring about yourself but others</p>
    
    <p>Caring feels like you caring about your soul. Like
    you wanting to protect yourself from dangerous and fire.
    Caring might not be easy somethimes because people 
    can take it in the wrong way and punish you for it. 
    Me just wanting to help makes me feel blessed for having 
    the courage take a step that most people are afraid to do.
    <3>I believe that caring is you sharing your happiness with 
    someone else.</3>
