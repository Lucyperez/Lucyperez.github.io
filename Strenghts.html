         <h3 id="Organizer">Organizer</h3>
    <p>I believe that organizer is being able to know the things
    you have plan for the week, months and years.
    Organizer is scheduling your world to make it better.I believe 
    that having a list of things in my life helps me have contro 
    over the time.Just having my life organize gives me a good 
    step ahead than everyone one else. I believe that organizing 
    little things brings me big joy, accomplisment and responsability 
    in life. </p>
    
    <p>Being organized is a big responsability in my life and 
    a daily thing I do every day. It doesn't only help me feel organized 
    but makes me feel more confident with myself. An example, is waking up in
    the morning, going to school, coming back home, doing homework,
    going to church,etc. I see this theme in my life by
    always keeping all my work organized in school or out of school</p>
    
    <h4>How it feels to use my strength.</h4>
    <p>Being organized is having an idea of your day.
    Just having an idea of how my life would look the next day 
    sometimes can feel stressing but also exciding. One reason 
    why it would be stressing is due to all the homework I would
    get and the hours spend at school. Other than that it's good life.
    When using my strength I feel great most of the time because 
    it helps me keep track of the things that suround me.</p>
    
    <p>Organizer is being able to do things in a specific other.

    <h3 id="Achieving">Achieving</h3>
    <p>Achieving is you having more energy and more goals than other people.
    You love a sense of accomplishment.You are in a hurry to get 
    started and make things happen because you almost always have
    a list in your mind of the things you want to get done. It is 
    fun to achieve small goals and even more exciting to achieve 
    big goals that challenge you.The more things you accomplish
    the better you feel about yourself. Achieving is wanting to 
    do more than enough. </p>
    
    <p>I see achievement in my life when I get good 
    grades, when I get things done on time. When people congradualte
    me from working hard. Like my family and friends.</p>
   
    <p> Being able to use this stregth feels like wanting 
    to do more. Feels like you just want to keep going and 
    never stoping. Achieving things feels greate when things are 
    done to help others. For example, at Sant Elizabeth I'm an 
    altar server, when your infront of more than 400 people it 
    feels nurvous but exiting too. Once you finish serving 
    it's like a deep breath you take to relax yourself. 
    Since being an altar server is just not helping out
    out being infront of lots of people. Accomplishing a
    goal is like you wanting to cry for succeeding even 
    if it's not winning.  </p>

    <h3 id="Caring">Caring</h3>
    <p>I believe that helping others is very important. 
    Caring about their needs is like caring about you.
     Caring is like want to make the world better by helping 
     people in small ways or big ways. When someone feels 
     left out, I help him or her be part of my group.
     I to encourage people, to share with others, and help
     them learn what they miss. I like helping others even 
     if they don want my help.  </p>
    
    <p>Caring comes up a lot with my little brother because
    he doesn have a lot of pacients and. I care a lot about him 
    because he's the youngest and how he doesn know a lot of things.
    I take care of him everyday even if it≈õ annoying. Caring is not 
    only caring about yourself but others</p>
    
    <p>Caring feels like you caring about your soul. Like
    you wanting to protect yourself from dangerous and fire.
    Caring might not be easy somethimes because people 
    can take it in the wrong way and punish you for it. 
    Me just wanting to help makes me feel blessed for having 
    the courage take a step that most people are afraid to do.
    I believe that caring feels like you putting drops of happiness 
    in your bucket.
